## Source File Analysis

The source file to our project is a csv file containing rating and reviews of various movies.<br>
**Dataset URL:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jyotmakadiya/popular-movies-and-tv-shows-amazon-prime-netflix <br>
**Path in project:** Documentation/Popular Movies TV shows from Prime Videos Netflix version_3.csv<br>
***** _Please note that in the code we have placed it in the Bronze Volumes movie.movie_bronze.dataset-movies to fetch the data._ ***** <br>

It contains the following fields:-
<table>[](url)
<tr><th>Field</th><th> Description</th>
<tr><td>[Blank]</td><td>No definition for this field. Only obeservation is this field holds ID - 1 value</td></tr>

## Creation of Medallion Architecture

**Notebook Path:** _Movie-Data-Engineering-Using-Databricks/Create medallion Architecture - movie/create medellion architecture for movies.ipynb_<br>

With notebook we creating the Medallion Architecture. First we create the Catalog named movies. Inside the catalog we create three Schemas:-
- movie_bronze
- movie_silver
- movie_gold

Once the notebook is run successfully we will see the following output in Catalog

## Load Data in Bronze

**Notebook Path:** _Movie-Data-Engineering-Using-Databricks/Job pipeline setup for refresh Bronze, Silver and Gold layer Data/Create job pipeline for refreshing bronze and silver layer.ipynb_<br>

In this notebook we load the csv file into a record in bronze layer called movies. The table is created as movie.movie_bronze.movies. It contains the raw data as it is we have in the csv source file.

This table will be the source of data for us to build the tables in Silver Layer.

## Load Data in Silver

As part of Cleaning and Transforming exercise in this step we are also doing a basic bit of data modelling. We have created a schema to separate out Master Data and Transactional Data.<br>

Before proceeding let us see the ERD Diagram of the Silver layer schema that we have created.

Let's break down the motivation behind the data model.<br>
